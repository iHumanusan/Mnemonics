# **Lesson 6**

---
## **1. _N を V (transitive)_**

- The particle **を** is used to indicate the **direct object** of a transitive verb.  
- **を** is used only in writing the particle.

---
## **2. _N を します_**

- A wide range of nouns can be used as the object of **します**, meaning that the action denoted by the noun is performed.

---
## **3. _なに／何 を しますか_**

- This is a question used to ask about someone's actions.

---
## **4. _なん and なに_**

- Both **なん** and **なに** mean "what".
- **なん** is used in the following cases:
    1. When it precedes a word whose first sound is in the **た-row**, **だ-row**, or **な-row**.
        - **なんで** is used to ask _"Why?"_ as well as _"How?"_    
        - **なにで** can be used when the speaker wants to clearly ask _"How?"_
    2. When using it with a **counter suffix**.
- **なに** is used in all other cases aside from 1) and 2).

---
## **5. _N(place) で V_**

- When added after a noun denoting a place, the particle **で** indicates that an action occurs **in that place**.

---
## **6. _Vませんか_**

- This expression is used when the speaker wants to **invite someone** to do something.    

---
## **7. _Vましょう_**

- This expression is used when the speaker is **positively inviting** the listener to do something together.
- It is also used when **responding positively** to an invitation.
- **Vませんか** and **Vましょう** both invite someone to do something, but:
    - **Vませんか** → shows more consideration for the listener
    - **Vましょう** → is more proactive/forward

---
## **8. _〜か_**

- This **か** indicates that the listener has _received and accepted_ some new information.
- It is used in the same way as the **か** in **そうですか** (see Lesson 2–8).

---
# **Lesson 7**

---
### ***1. N (tool/means) で V***

The particle **で** indicates a _method or means_ used for an action.

---
### ***2. 「Word/Sentence」は〜語でなんですか***

This question is used to ask how to say a word or sentence in another language.

---

### ***3. N₁ (person) に N₂ を あげます, etc.***

- Verbs like **あげます、かします、おしえます** indicate _imparting_ things or information, so they must be used with a noun saying **to whom** those things or information are imparted.  
- The particle **に** is used to denote the _recipient_.

---

### ***4. N₁ (person) に N₂ を もらいます, etc.***

-  Verbs like **もらいます、かります、ならいます** indicate _receiving_ things or information, so they are used with a noun indicating the person **from whom** those things or information are received.  
- The particle **に** is used to denote that person.

- **から** can be used instead of **に** in this sentence pattern.
- **から** is always used when receiving something from an _organisation_ such as a company or school rather than a person.    

---
### ***5. もう Vました***

**もう** means _“already”_ and is used with **Vました**.  
In this case, **Vました** means the action has been completed.

For the question **もう Vましたか**:
- **はい、もう Vました** — affirmative (the action is already completed)
- **いいえ、Vていません** or **いいえ、まだです** — negative (the action is not completed yet)
**Note:**  
**いいえ、Vませんでした** is _not used_ in this situation because it means "I did not do it (in the past)," not "It is not yet completed."

---
### ***6. Omission of particles***

Particles are often omitted in _informal speech_ when the relationships between the words are obvious.

---
# **Lesson 8**

---
### ***1. Adjectives***

Adjectives are used as predicates, and in sentences like **Nは adj です** they indicate the state of a noun or modify a noun.  
They are divided into two groups: **い-adjectives** and **な-adjectives**, depending on how they inflect.

---
### ***2. N は な-adj［な］です　／　N は い-adj（〜い）です***

Adjective sentences that are non-past and affirmative end in **です**, which shows politeness.  
な-adjectives drop **な** before **です**, while い-adjectives retain **〜い**.
#### **• な-adj［な］ → な-adjじゃ（では）ありません**

The non-past negative of a な-adjective is formed by dropping **な** and attaching **じゃ（では）ありません**.
#### **• い-adj（〜い） → 〜くないです**

The non-past negative of an い-adjective is formed by dropping the final **い** and attaching **くないです**.  

**Note:** The negative of **いいです** is **よくないです**.
#### **• Adjectival Inflections**

||な-adjectives|い-adjectives|
|---|---|---|
|Non-past affirmative|しんせつです|たかいです|
|Non-past negative|しんせつじゃ（では）ありません|たかくないです|
#### **• Questions using adjective sentences**

These are formed the same way as noun (Lesson 1) and verb sentences (Lesson 4).  
To answer, the adjective is repeated.  
Expressions like **そうです** or **ちがいます** _cannot_ be used.

---
### ***3. な-adj な N　／　い-adj（〜い）N***

When an adjective modifies a noun, it is placed before the noun.  
な-adjectives **keep な** when modifying a noun.

---
### ***4. 〜が、***

**が** connects two statements in an antithetical (contrasting) relationship.  
When both clauses are adjective clauses with the same subject:
- If the first clause remarks positively, the following clause remarks negatively, and vice versa.

---
### ***5. とても / あまり***

Both are adverbs of degree placed before the adjectives they modify.
- **とても** — used in affirmative sentences; means **“very.”**    
- **あまり** — used with negatives; means **“not very.”**

---
### ***6. N は どうですか***

Used to ask the listener’s **impression, opinion or feelings** about a thing, place, person, etc. they have experienced, visited, or met.

---
### ***7. N₁ は どんな N₂ ですか***

**どんな** modifies a noun and asks about the **state or nature** of a person or thing.

---
### ***8. そうですね***

In Lesson 5, **そうですね** expressed agreement or sympathy.  
In this lesson, it is used when the speaker is **thinking**.

---
# _Lesson 9_

---

### _1. N が あります / わかります 　ー　N が (すき) 好きです / (きらい) 嫌いです / (じょうず) 上手です / (へた) 下手です_

- The objects of some verbs and adjectives are marked with **が**.
    
---
### _2. どんな N_

- In addition to the responses explained in Lesson 8, a question using **どんな** may also be answered by stating a **specific name**.

---
### _3. よく / だいたい / たくさん / (すこし) 少し / あまり / ぜんぜん

- These adverbs are placed **before verbs** to modify them.

|                          | **Adverbs of degree**               | **Adverbs of quantity** |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Used with an affirmative | よく わかります<br>だいたい わかります<br>すこし わかります | たくさん あります<br>すこし あります   |
| Used with a negative     | あまり わかりません<br>ぜんぜん わかりません    <br>   | あまり ありません<br>ぜんぜん ありません |

**Note:**
- **すこし、ぜんぜん、あまり** can also modify adjectives.    

---
### _4. 〜から、〜_

- A statement before **から** gives the **reason** for a statement after it.
- It is also possible to state something **first** and add the reason **after** by using **〜から**.
---
### _5. どうして_

- The interrogative **どうして** is used to ask the **reason** for something.
- **から** is placed at the end of the reply giving the reason.    
- The question **どうしてですか** is used to ask the reason for something the other person has just said, instead of repeating what they said.
    
---

# _Lesson 10_

---
### _1. N が あります / います_

**あります** and **います** indicate the existence of a thing, person, etc.  
Since this sentence type simply states that something exists, the noun representing that thing or person is marked with **が**.
#### _1)_ **あります**
- Used when what is present is **inanimate** and cannot move by itself, such as plants and objects.
#### _2)_ **います**
- Used when what is present is **animate** and can move by itself, like people and animals.

---
### _2. Place に N が あります / います_

This form is used to say **what** or **who** is in a certain place.
- The particle **に** marks the **place** where the thing or person exists.
- The interrogative **なに** is used to ask _what_ is present.
- The interrogative **だれ** is used to ask _who_ is present.

**[Note]**
- After interrogatives, the particle is always **が**.  
    (× なに**は** , × だれ**は**)    

---
### _3. N は Place に あります / います_

This sentence takes the noun (the thing/person) from pattern 2 and makes it the **topic**, marked with **は**.  
The noun must be something both the speaker and listener know.

**[Note]**
- This can be replaced with **N は Place です** (see Lesson 3).    
- In this case, the interrogative (**どこ**) or the place noun before です is **not** marked with に.

---
### _4. N₁ (thing/person/place) の N₂ (position)_

When N₂ is a noun expressing **direction or position** (e.g. うえ、した、まえ、うしろ、みぎ、ひだり、なか、そと、となり、ちかく、あいだ), it shows a positional relationship with **N₁**.

**[Note]**
- Just like nouns of place, these can also take **で** when indicating the **location of an action**.

---
### _5. N₁ や N₂_

As explained in Lesson 4:
- **と** is used to list all items completely.
- **や** is used to list **representative** items (two or more).
- **など** may follow the last noun to emphasize that the list is not exhaustive.

---
### _6. 〜か_

In real conversation, people often repeat or confirm the **main point** of a question using **〜か** before giving their actual reply.
